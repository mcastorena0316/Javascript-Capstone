<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

The objective of this project was to design and build a platform game like the one in [Space Shooter Game](https://learn.yorkcs.com/category/tutorials/gamedev/phaser-3/build-a-space-shooter-with-phaser-3/) using Phaser and Javascript among other technologies.

Live version of the project: [Live version](https://cat-gun.netlify.app/)

<!-- THE GAME -->
## The game

In this never-ending game, you will face 3 different enemies at random times, and you have to use your laser to make them explode. Every enemy gives you a different score, and you need to avoid getting hit by their lasers or overlap with one of them. Every moment one of these events occurs, you will lose one life. 

You have 7 lives, after this, you will lose, and be redirected to a Game Over screen where you can submit your name and check for the highest scores.  


<!-- INSPIRATION -->
### Inspiration

This game is inspired in my cat "Benito" and the villains include one of his worst enemies: dogs, snakes (and reptiles in general), and the representation of my husband who is always trying to hug him (which he doesn't like at all).


<!-- HOW TO PLAY -->
### How to Play

You can move around the screen using the arrow keys <div ><img src="assets/keys.png"></div> for moving around and use the Space Bar <div ><img src="assets/spaceBar.png"></div> to shoot whenever you see a bad guy.
